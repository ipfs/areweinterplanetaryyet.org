### The [IPFS][] protocol stands for InterPlanetary File System, but when will it actually be used in Space?

The first confirmed mission to use IPFS was [announced][] in January 2023 by the
[Filecoin Foundation][] and [Lockheed Martin][]. The implementation designed for this is
[Myceli][], a minimal IPFS system written in Rust, and developed by [Little Bear Labs][].

This first mission deployed Myceli to a Lockheed Martin [Linuss cubesat](https://news.lockheedmartin.com/linuss-small-sats-mission) and transferred the IPFS white paper and an image of the [Filecoin corgi mascot "biscuit"](https://twitter.com/Filecoin/status/1673663805463617538) up to the spacecraft and then downloaded them back again, verifying on both sides. The mission was completed in late 2023 and announced at Davos on January 16, 2024. Read the [Filecoin Foundation blog post](https://fil.org/blog/filecoin-foundation-successfully-deploys-interplanetary-file-system-ipfs-in-space/) and the [press release](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/filecoin-foundation-successfully-deploys-interplanetary-file-system-ipfs-in-space-302035233.html).
